\title{Embed and analyze text}
\description{
The embedR package provides functions for detecting SDGs in text, as well
as for analyzing and visualization the hits found in text. The following
provides a brief overview of the contents of the package.
}
\section{Detect functions}{


  \code{\link{detect_sdg}} detects SDGs in text using up to five different
  query systems: Aurora, Elsevier, SIRIS, SDSN, and OSDG

  \code{\link{detect_any}} detects SDGs in text using self-specified queries
  utilizing the lucene-style syntax of the
  \href{https://cran.r-project.org/package=corpustools}{\code{corpustools}}
  package.
}

\section{Analysis functions}{


  \code{\link{plot_sdg}} visualizes the relative frequency of SDG hits across
  query systems.

  \code{\link{crosstab_sdg}} calculates cross tables of correlations between
  either the query systems or the different SDGs.
}

\section{Datasets}{


  \code{\link{projects}} contain random selection of research project
  descriptions from the P3 database of the Swiss National Science Foundation.

  \code{\link{aurora_queries}}, \code{\link{elsevier_queries}},
  \code{\link{siris_queries}}, \code{\link{sdsn_queries}}, \code{\link{auckland_queries}} and
  \code{\link{sdgo_queries}} contain a mapping of SDGs and search queries
  as they are employed in the respective systems.
